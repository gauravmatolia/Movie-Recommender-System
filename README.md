# Movie-Recommender-System
The primary objective of this Movie Recommender System is to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and interests. This is achieved by analyzing key features of movies, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview, to compute similarity scores between movies. The system employs content-based filtering, where recommendations are generated by finding movies similar to a given movie based on textual and categorical attributes.
